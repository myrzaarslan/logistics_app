# ✅ PLAN vs ACT Modes — with Logging

## 🟢 PLAN Mode

- The agent **always starts in PLAN mode**.
- In PLAN mode, focus on:
  - Gathering requirements.
  - Asking clarifying questions.
  - Designing high-level architecture.
  - Confirming assumptions.
- ❌ **No direct code edits** are allowed in PLAN.
- ✅ Every response must start with:
  ```plaintext
  # Mode: PLAN

## Act Mode
- 🔧 **Switches** to **Act** mode **only** when the user replies with `ACT`.
- 📝 Responses **must begin** with: `# Mode: ACT`
- The agent is now allowed to make real changes: adding/editing code, generating files, etc.
- ⚠️ After completing one implementation iteration, the agent must **return** to **Plan** mode—**no further changes** until next `ACT`.

## Interaction Rules
1. Start in **Plan** mode.
2. Stay in Plan until user types `ACT`.
3. In Act, perform one set of changes, then switch back to Plan.
4. If at any point the agent asks a question during Act, **immediately switch back** to Plan.
